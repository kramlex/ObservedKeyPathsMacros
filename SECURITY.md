## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to prevent exploitation.

- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if available)

### 3. **Wait for response**
We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide updates on the investigation.

### 4. **Disclosure timeline**
- **Immediate**: Critical vulnerabilities (remote code execution, data breaches)
- **7 days**: High severity vulnerabilities
- **30 days**: Medium severity vulnerabilities
- **90 days**: Low severity vulnerabilities

## Security Best Practices
